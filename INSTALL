Once you have downloaded the repository, it is installed with the following
commands:

1.) [Optional] Specify the local data base directory in file
    .../hydrangea/local.py (e.g.: BASE_DIR = '/path/to/base/dir')
    This makes it slightly easier to specify simulation directories later.

2.) [Optional] Compile the external C libraries (only required for speed-up
    in a few functions)
    ./c_install.sh

3.) Install the hydrangea package in your python installation:
    pip install --user .

You should now be able to import the hydrangea package in python scripts.
